## Professional Experience

**ETRI**, Daejeon, Korea

* I had performed several research and development projects including home
networking software development and protocol development for IPTV
services over access networks from 2000 to 2005.

* I had also participated in a project on resource-aware device collaboration
middleware for multi-screen services from 2011 to 2014.

* I had also joined an SDN project where I had developed the SDN-based control system for inter-networking multi-clouds from 2014 to 2017.

* I have been working in the Hyper-connected Intelligent Infrastructure project since 2017 where I am interested in developing autonomic control technologies for highly distributed data infrastructure.
